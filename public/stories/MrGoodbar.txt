It was raining sugar that night—thick, sticky drops that clung to your shoes and your conscience. I was nursing a lukewarm root beer float in a dingy malt shop on 5th and Fudge when the call came in.

"Mr. Goodbar's dead," said the voice on the other end. "Found him floating face-down in the Chocolate River. Wrapper torn. Nuts everywhere."

Mr. Goodbar. The golden boy of Candyland. Rich. Smooth. A nut in every crowd loved him—or pretended to.

I’m Detective Sour Patch. Half sweet, half bitter, and entirely out of patience. The kind of guy you call when things go sour—real sour.

I lit a gumdrop cigar and walked the sticky streets to the riverbank. There he was, melting into the current like yesterday’s fondue.

I didn’t buy the story that it was an accident. Mr. Goodbar didn’t just slip and fall—he was the kind of bar who knew how to walk a tightrope of sugar deals and cocoa politics.

I started digging. Not in dirt—Candyland’s too clean for that—but in secrets.

First stop: Miss Peppermint Pattie. Cool exterior, sharp edge, heart frozen since Goodbar left her for a newer, glossier wrapper.

"He said I was too classic," she sneered, lighting a cinnamon stick. "So I guess he wanted something more modern—until someone modernized his face."

She had motive, but no fudge on her hands.

Next: Reese. All peanut, no tact. His hands shook as he unwrapped a story full of cracks.

“He was planning a merger,” Reese whispered, glancing over his shoulder. “Goodbar wanted to go global. Almond, puffed rice, even coconut. He called it 'Fusion.' Said I was outdated. Said we were relics.”

That’s when it clicked. In a world made of sugar, pride's the hardest thing to chew.

Back at the scene, I spotted it—something everyone missed. A single caramel string caught on a candy cane branch.

Only one guy leaves that behind.

Caramel Lou. A sticky-fingered enforcer with a record longer than a licorice whip. He didn’t talk much, but the hot caramel drips on his boots did the screaming.

"Goodbar wouldn’t share the Fusion formula," he muttered under his breath. "Tried to keep it all for himself. So the boss made sure he never talked again."

Case closed. Lou went to the Ice Cream Cooler—hard time. Real cold.

I went back to my float. Took a long sip. Even in a place built on sugar, some endings are bitter.

But that’s Candyland.

And I’m still Sour.
